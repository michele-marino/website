Our research focuses on modeling cardiovascular tissues as dynamic, living entities. By integrating complex mechanical descriptions of tissue behavior with the biochemical pathways that influence growth, remodeling, and active responses, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of cardiovascular biomechanics in health and disease.

Biochemical pathways are triggered to react to such stimuli and maintain a functional and homeostatic behaviour. The main question in medicine is whether body response is sufficient to restore homeostasis, leads to an maladapted response, or is responsible for the development of pathologies."

Our understanding of molecular mechanics has been integrated with in vitro test results, using collagen hybridizing peptides, to create an elasto-plastic-damage constitutive model of arterial tissue mechanics. In this model, the evolution laws of damage variables are validated based on independent experimental quantifications of molecular damage.",

As confirmed by clinical evidence, such dynamics are bimodular, being characterized by an early tissue resorption and lumen enlargement, followed by late tissue growth and vessel constriction. ",
