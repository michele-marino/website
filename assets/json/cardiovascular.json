Our research focuses on modeling cardiovascular tissues as dynamic, living entities. By integrating complex mechanical descriptions of tissue behavior with the biochemical pathways that influence growth, remodeling, and active responses, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of cardiovascular biomechanics in health and disease.

In this model, the evolution laws of damage variables are validated based on independent experimental quantifications of molecular damage.",
